<!--    --><!--<!--        <img src="--><!--<!--">-->
<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                The music Belgrade artist Nenad
 Marković makes under the coded 33.10.3402 name was first brought to our
 attention by Andrew Hogge’s ESP Institute label who commenced a series 
of four Mecanica 12″s inspired by “opium dens and whorehouses” in late 
2013. Marković actually debuted the project a year earlier on a highly 
limited self-titled 12” from KUNSTKOPF, a cult Düsseldorf label that has
 also issued music from Lena Platonos, Tolouse Low Trax and Musiccargo’s
 Gordon Pohl. In addition to his work as 33.10.3402, Marković has also 
released an album under his given name for Prins Thomas’s Internasjonal 
label.</p><p>If you are familiar with these 33.10.3402 releases or the 
record Marković released through the Music From Memory offshoot Second 
Circle, you will know it’s pretty difficult to sum up his sound in 
simple terms. Odd recording methods are clearly deployed and you are as 
likely to hear a mass of low frequencies and broken hi-hats as you are a
 deadly rhythm tracks or some lilting ambience reminiscent of Gigi 
Masin. All of which makes news of his union with L.I.E.S. most 
interesting, with a three-track single due later this month.</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/33103402-153186674778097</p><p></p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Ali Guney</h1>

<!--    --><!--<!--        <img src="--><!--<!--">-->
<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Dadub is a meeting of two 
minds, Daniele Antezza and Giovanni Conti, a duo whose output is 
underpinned by a mutual curiosity. The result? Startling electronic 
music productions, one of the best live acts in the scene and the 
innovative Artefacts Mastering studio. The collaboration started not in 
their native Italy, but in Berlin. Daniele arrived in Berlin with the 
kernel of Dadub, a project he’d begun in 2008 with a release on the 
label A Quite Bump. Daniele came via Rome where he’d plunged himself 
into production, studying electronic music. Giovanni had been drawn to 
Berlin to work on interactive digital arts projects, honing his 
knowledge of hardware and software. Once they met it was only a matter 
of time before Dadub became a two-man project.</p><p>Twinned by a 
fascination of process, and a love of Lee Scratch Perry’s mix board 
experiments, they take dub and push it into the deepest corners of 
techno and out to the ambient fringes. Frustrated by identikit sounds in
 electronic music they set about pouring their technical knowledge 
together in search of innovation.</p><p>They describe their approach in 
the studio as ‘like making scent’. Dadub take sound and process it to 
extract depth and expose human warmth. With this studio outlook it was 
natural for Dadub to move into mastering. They delved in and Artefacts 
Mastering emerged: mastering that involves no presets and a policy of 
adjusting every track entirely from scratch. It’s exactly this type of 
discipline, their use of open strategies instead of formulas that also 
makes Dadub so dynamic live. Live they layer dubbing and synthesis, they
 take Dadub material and deconstruct or reconstruct it spontaneously. 
Their sets are seriously deep and have been showcased internationally at
 Barcelona’s Sonar festival, Germany’s Melt! festival and in clubs from 
Berlin to Moscow and New York.</p><p>There’s something alchemical about 
Dadub whether live, on record or when commanding the studio. And when 
considering their mixes for CLR, Electric Deluxe or Electronic 
Explorations, it’s clear that when given space and length they’re 
ambitious. In early 2013 Stroboscopic Artefacts released Dadub’s most 
ambitious work to date their debut album ‘You Are Eternity’. The 
critically acclaimed record is the product of over two years of deep 
studio research, experimental synthesis strategies and manages to 
capture the length and breadth of Dadub’s unique vision.</p><p>www.soundcloud.com/dadub</p><p>http://www.facebook.com/dadubofficial</p><p>www.dadub.net</p><p>http://www.stroboscopicartefacts.com/dadub.html</p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Dan Hett</h1>

 preferred mystery and myth, and the Tetrahymena EP on Leisure System is
 a scorching assertion of their capacity for hallucinogenic abrasion. 
Tetrahymena wanders through decommissioned factories and an omnipresent 
chemical haze, evasive and contemplative like the last man alive in a 
crumbling steel city. Whether in the ethereal voices and plunging bass 
of title track “Tetrahymena,” the unidentified flying objects droning 
maliciously in the thunderous weapon “Gene Silencing,” or the retch and 
hiss of arpeggiated bad trip “Zygote,” it’s a transportive journey of 
dread as only Dopplereffekt can create. Leisure System is proud to 
release the Tetrahymena EP, an essential vision of dance floor dystopia 
from one of the most consistently compelling artists in electronic 
music.</p><p>Curated in collaboration with TodaysArt</p><p></p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink</h1>

<!--    --><!--<!--        <img src="--><!--<!--">-->
<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Hans-Joachim Roedelius&nbsp;is 
a&nbsp;German&nbsp;experimental,&nbsp;ambient&nbsp;and&nbsp;electronic 
musician. He is best known as a co-founder of 
the&nbsp;krautrock&nbsp;groups&nbsp;Cluster&nbsp;and&nbsp;Harmonia&nbsp;and
 for his work in the ambient jazz trio Aquarello.</p><p>Kluster, Cluster and Harmonia</p><p>In
 1968 Roedelius co-founded the music commune known as “Human Being” and 
co-formed&nbsp;Zodiak Free Arts Lab, the center of Berlin’s Underground 
Culture at the time, with conceptual artist&nbsp;Conrad Schnitzler. He 
met&nbsp;Dieter Moebius&nbsp;at the Zodiak. In 1970 Roedelius, 
Schnitzler and Moebius formed&nbsp;Kluster. In 1971 Schnitzler left the 
group to start a long-running solo career and Moebius and Roedelius 
anglicised the band’s name to&nbsp;Cluster. At first Cluster worked 
along the same lines as their parent group, signed first 
to&nbsp;Philips&nbsp;then to&nbsp;Brain.</p><p>In 1973 Roedelius and 
Moebius worked with&nbsp;Neu!&nbsp;guitarist&nbsp;Michael 
Rother&nbsp;for the first time. Rother helped to co-produce their third 
album,&nbsp;Zuckerzeit, that moved the band’s style further from 
avant-garde ‘noise’ to a more melodic music, similar to 
modern-daytrance. Roedelius, Moebius and Rother 
toured&nbsp;Germany&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Low Countries&nbsp;as a trio from 
early 1973 and decided to record an album together under the name 
of&nbsp;Harmonia.&nbsp;Musik von Harmonia&nbsp;was released on the back 
of a huge publicity campaign by Brain. Harmonia released one further 
album initially, 1975’s&nbsp;Deluxe. British musician&nbsp;Brian Eno, a 
fan of both Cluster and Harmonia, joined them for several jams, the 
result of which was released in 1997 as&nbsp;Tracks &amp; Traces. Rother
 left Harmonia to pursue his solo career and Cluster returned to the 
studio to record&nbsp;Sowiesoso&nbsp;which was released on&nbsp;Sky 
Records. Brian Eno, who had returned to Germany to work with&nbsp;David 
Bowie, worked on two albums with Cluster: 1977’s&nbsp;Cluster &amp; 
Eno&nbsp;and 1978’s&nbsp;After the Heat, the latter of which gained the 
band much attention in the British music press. A further Cluster album 
produced by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann&nbsp;Großes 
Wasser&nbsp;extended Cluster’s music into long form.Solo career</p><p>Roedelius’
 solo career began with&nbsp;Durch die Wüste&nbsp;in 1978 and 
then&nbsp;Jardin au Fou&nbsp;in 1979. This album laid down Roedelius’ 
future style: melodic piano and (often faked) acoustic instruments 
played with a sharp tinge of electronics. The first of the 
lengthy&nbsp;Selbstportrait&nbsp;series was released in 1979, being 
material done beside his work with Cluster and Harmonia, without the 
input of his collaborators. Recorded on only two tracks, the 
Selbstportraits make up the backbone of Roedelius’ early solo 
recordings. Leaving Sky in 1982, his work took a 
more&nbsp;new-age&nbsp;style as he signed 
to&nbsp;Virgin’s&nbsp;Venture&nbsp;sub-label. During this period, his 
best selling solo album&nbsp;Geschenk des Augenblicks – Gift of the 
Moment&nbsp;was released.</p><p>He was dropped by Venture in 1989 and 
began releasing on a variety of small labels, 
notably&nbsp;Multimood&nbsp;and&nbsp;Prudence. He began to venture into 
the newly emerging genre oftechno, starting with 1991’s&nbsp;Der 
Ohrenspiegel, whose 25-minute opener,&nbsp;Reflectorum&nbsp;displays 
some of the characteristics of the later&nbsp;Sinfonia 
Contempora&nbsp;series. By 1994 Roedelius’ style was a heady mix of 
amateur electronics and sometimes clichéd&nbsp;ambient&nbsp;jazz. An 
album from this year;&nbsp;Theatreworks, was rewarded with the title 
“album of the month” by experimental music magazine&nbsp;The Wire. 
Arguably the biggest turning point in Roedelius’ career came in 1994 as 
well. The release of&nbsp;Sinfonia Contempora No. 1: Von Zeit zu 
Zeit&nbsp;marked, in Roedelius’ own words, “Since the beginning of my 
career nothing was more important to me than to find my own musical 
language. I have, so I believe, eventually found it.” The album consists
 of mismatched tape fragments (from numerous jams ranging from the 
mid-eighties to the mid-nineties) multitracked over the top of each 
other to create a disjointed but oddly musical sound.</p><p>Sinfonia 
Contempora No. 2: La Nordica (Salz Des Nordens)&nbsp;was released in 
1996, making for a much more sinister and muddy sound than its 
predecessor. Also released in this period was&nbsp;Selbstportrait VI: 
The Diary of the Unforgotten, the first of the 
modern&nbsp;Selbstportraits. Now, rather than merely remastering the 
seventies tapes, Roedelius also played over them, the sound 
montage&nbsp;Homage á Forst&nbsp;samples many Harmonia and Cluster 
tracks into the mix.Reformation of Cluster</p><p>In the meantime, 
Cluster had reformed. 1990’s&nbsp;Apropos Cluster&nbsp;was an update for
 the band, being a work of avant-techno not dissimilar in style 
to&nbsp;Großes Wasser. In 1996 Cluster embarked on two international 
tours, one of Japan and one of America. Both tours would be summarised 
on the following years live albums. The new sound of Cluster learns from
 the&nbsp;Sinfonia Contempora&nbsp;sound whilst adding Moebius’ 
distinctive sound.</p><p>21st century: solo work and collaborations</p><p>The
 turn of the century was Roedelius’ most productive year, with no less 
than eight albums being released between 2000 and 2001. Reprising 
the&nbsp;Selbstportrait&nbsp;series for the seventh time in 2000, 
Roedelius composed entirely new tracks for the first time 
on&nbsp;Selfportrait VII: dem Wind voran – ahead of the wind. The new 
millennium also saw Roedelius begin to work with other, usually younger,
 musicians than he had done since the late eighties.</p><p>Another 
series is&nbsp;Lieder vom Steinfeld. Begun in 1995, Roedelius recites 
poems over these pieces, primarily in his native German language. In 
2001 Roedelius worked with Conrad Schnitzler again for the first time 
since 1971. The record “Acon I”has been released in Japan by 
“Capt.Trip-Records&nbsp;.</p><p>Roedelius had been growing substantially
 in fame since Cluster began touring again in 1996. He is often cited by
 electronic musicians and releases several albums a year, many of which 
are collaborations with modern musicians who are fans. He works 
extensively with&nbsp;Tim Story&nbsp;and 
released&nbsp;Fibre&nbsp;recorded with Jez Coad, Martin Barker and Georg
 Taylor an album which has reached 13th place in “the Third Uncut 
Playlist of 2009” for&nbsp;Uncut Magazine, ahead of&nbsp;Bruce 
Springsteen’s&nbsp;Working on a Dream.Qluster</p><p>In November 2010 it 
was announced that Cluster had split up for the third time. In the 
official announcement, the split up was described 
as&nbsp;Moebius&nbsp;leaving the group. In the wake of this news, 
Roedelius announced that he was beginning a new project called Qluster, 
to follow on from Cluster and&nbsp;Kluster. The band is made up of 
Roedelius and accomplished electronic musician&nbsp;Onnen Bock&nbsp;with
 third member Armin Metz and released a trilogy consisting of “Rufen”, 
“Fragen” and “Antworten” (Calling,&nbsp;Asking&nbsp;andAnswering) in 
2011. The then released a recording of a live concert made at 
CTM-Festival in Berlin, titled “Lauschen” ( Listening

<!--    --><!--<!--        <img src="--><!--<!--">-->
<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Herndon has become a leading 
light in contemporary music by experimenting within the outer reaches of
 dance music and pop songwriting possibilities. A galvanising statement,
 new album Platform signals Herndon’s transformation as an electronic 
musician to a singular voice.</p><p>Born in Tennessee, but reared on 
music abroad, Herndon broke out from her formative years in Berlin’s 
minimal techno scene to repatriate to San Francisco, where she currently
 lives and studies as a doctoral candidate at Stanford’s Center for 
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).</p><p>With the 
progressive themes of Platform, Holly Herndon could be viewed as the 
21st century’s answer to the protest singer were she not also a composer
 of such sublime music. Old categories don’t fit for Herndon, just as 
the lineage of protest-music fails to capture the scope of Platform’s 
appeal and its potential for mass disruption.</p><p>To achieve Platform,
 Herndon has opened up her process to vital artists and thinkers from 
her creative circle, leading by example to tackle a host of topics 
ranging from systemic inequality, surveillance states and neo-feudalism.
 Platform underscores the need for new fantasies and strategic 
collective action.</p><p>Among the collaborators are composer and drag 
performer Colin Self (vocals on “Unequal”), contemporary artist Spencer 
Longo (co-writer on “Locker Leak”), rogue production outfit Amnesia 
Scanner (co-producers of “An Exit”), Ensemble Dal Niente’s soprano voice
 Amanda DeBoer Bartlett (vocals on “Dao”), Berlin Community Radio’s ASMR
 ambassador Claire Tolan (voice on “Lonely at the Top”), and radical 
Dutch design studio Metahaven (visuals for “Home”). Influence of 
long-time collaborator and digital-DIY artist Mat Dryhurst is also 
echoed throughout.</p><p>Herndon’s debut album Movement, released in 
2012, showcased Herndon’s fascination with trance and the disjunctive 
sampling techniques pioneered by avant-garde composition. Subsequent 
singles ‘Chorus’ and ‘Home’ – offered in advance of Platform – humanised
 the laptop by celebrating its capacity for memory-storage and lamenting
 its vulnerability in light of revelations of mass surveillance.</p><p>Transitioning
 to Platform, Herndon’s music becomes even more visceral by channeling 
the chaos and clangor of transmediated experience. Close to a 
contemporized version of Einsturzende Neubaten’s industrial rhythms or 
Joe Meek’s fantastical alien productions, Herndon’s auditory palette 
samples the domestic and digital environments of her daily life.</p><p>Opposing
 the dystopic potential of a surveillance state and the specter of a 
monoculture, Platform seizes this unstable moment for a conscious shift 
in the pop and dance music conversation. Offering what Herndon describes
 as “a rupture, a paradisic gesture,” Platform is an optimistic 
breakthrough for Herndon, an appeal for progress, and a step toward new 
ways to love.</p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Ishac Bertran</h1>

<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith’s 
formative years were spent communing with nature on Orcas Island in the 
northwest region of Washington state, a place she describes as “one of 
the most magical and peaceful places I have ever been.” Though she 
wouldn’t begin experimenting with modular synthesis until many years 
later, her creative work continues to be infused with and inspired by 
the vitality and serenity of Orcas.</p><p>Smith left the island to 
attend Berklee College of Music, where she studied composition and sound
 engineering, initially focusing on her voice as her primary instrument,
 before switching to classical guitar and piano. She employed many of 
the skills she refined in college in her indie-folk band Ever Isles, but
 a fateful encounter with a neighbor who lent her a Buchla 100 
synthesizer, had a profound effect on her. Mesmerized by the Buchla’s 
potential, she explains “I got so distracted and enamored with the 
process of making sounds with it that I abandoned the next Ever Isles 
album.” Starting with rhythmic patterns and melodic pulses, she soon 
began sculpting lush and exciting worlds of sound.</p><p>http://www.kaitlynaureliasmith.com/</p><p>https://youtu.be/EUiypKnHmF8&nbsp;</p><p>https://youtu.be/Uhtar8FlgzU</p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Karsten Schmidt</h1>

 code, design, art &amp; craft skills. Originally from East Germany and 
starting in the deep end of the early 8-bit demo scene, for the past 25+
 years he’s been adopting a completely trans-disciplinary way of working
 and has been laterally involved in a wide range of creative 
disciplines. With his practice PostSpectacular, he’s been actively 
exploring current possibilities at the intersection of design, art, 
software development and education and applying this mixture hands-on to
 a variety of fields, from architecture, branding, digital fabrication, 
interactive installations, motion graphics &amp; music. A strong 
conceptual thinker and always striving for maximum creative freedom, 
Karsten’s design approach is based on treating ideas as malleable 
software at the heart, which in turn informs all other facets of each 
project.</p><p>When not creating, he regularly travels the world 
consulting, lecturing and teaching workshops about code literacy, open 
source and employing code as creative tool. He is a prolific contributor
 to several large open source projects, was an early contributor to the

experiment with minimalist analogue electronic hardware.</p><p>It was an
 extended mood piece evoking the vast expanse of the arctic tundra, it’s
 sonorous landscape and sense of isolation dissolved time and space.</p><p>Recorded
 in a tent using minimal equipment – this was long before the era of the
 laptop – the result was one of the coldest and sonorous recordings made
 to date. Empire described it as “slowly drowning in ice water, seeing 
the sun moving further away from you.”</p><p>The album ‘Low On Ice’ (The
 Icelandic Sessions), a unique monument of atmospheric poignancy and 
sonic radicalism, was chosen amongst the 50 most important electronic

<!--    --><!--<!--        <img src="--><!--<!--">-->
<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Dedicated to a bold and 
unlikely mixture of noise, batucada, samba and&nbsp;electronic, their 
sporadic live appearances have already become legendary 
and&nbsp;mythological.</p><p>Be it a punk squat in Belgium or the famous
 Venice Biennale of Architecture, Ninos&nbsp;Du Brasil, without fail, 
rally the troops, from every walk of life, and create some of&nbsp;the 
biggest festival style parties on the dance floor.</p><p>For those 
fortunate enough to have witnessed Ninos Du Brasil live, their 
stories&nbsp;comprise of otherworldly experiences. NDB’s condensed yet 
intense set is a fervent&nbsp;intermixture of old school techno, stadium
 spirit choruses, Carnival style parade&nbsp;celebrations unified with 
the physical intensity of old school hardcore shows.&nbsp;Their debut 
album, titled ’Muito NDB’ is a declared war against the stupidity 
and&nbsp;superficiality of pop music as well as the current reticence 
and behavioural&nbsp;inhibition of the dance halls and public venues .</p><p>The
 tracks on the album are weapons of percussion consisting of cuica , 
congas ,&nbsp;bells , Jambe , rollers , plates, claves , maracas , 
whistles , bells and animal calls —&nbsp;married with non-traditional 
instruments: bottles, cans, pieces of wood and&nbsp;undefined rubbish. 
The goal, to encourage the public to discover and embrace a&nbsp;sexual 
and instinctual approach to rhythm and existence . ‘Muito N.D.B.’ 
was&nbsp;ignorant but not stupid, visionary, risky, improper and 
excessive.</p><p>Throughout the early days of Ninos Du Brasil, the band 
wilfully chose to keep their&nbsp;identities and history secret. It 
wasn’t until the release of their debut record that fans&nbsp;discovered
 who the mystery beat masters were. Both Nico and Nicolo 
were&nbsp;members of one of the most respected, important and 
controversial ’90s hardcore /&nbsp;punk bands, With Love (released on 
Omar Rodriguez of The Mars Volta and At The&nbsp;Drive In’s label GSL).</p><p>‘Novos
 Mistérios’ (Hospital Productions 2014) follows their debut LP for 
La&nbsp;Tempesta International/Tannen Records with an acutely stripped 
down blend of&nbsp;mostly “live” recorded percussion and explorative 
electronic sound design.&nbsp;The project, and album, is a radical 
inversion and consolidation of the duo’s&nbsp;respective backgrounds in 
performance art, punk and indie bands. Inspired by the&nbsp;febrile 
humidity and sensory overload of Brasilian carnival music, they 
temper&nbsp;layeres of roiling, propulsive percussion with electronic 
drones, effects and tribalist&nbsp;vocals to militant, hypnotic effect. 
Six tracks charge between technoid polymetrics,&nbsp;kinky minimalism 
and meditative ritual with particular focus on rhythmelodic&nbsp;cadence
 and carefully constructed atmospheres drawing lines between the 
avantgarde&nbsp;coda of William Winant and Indonesian Gamelan on 
‘Essenghelo Tropical’, to&nbsp;Cut Hand’s voodoo invocations in ‘Legiõs 
De Cupins’, and the percussive moments&nbsp;of Brazilian metal legends 
in ‘Sepultura’.</p><p>The song ‘Sepultura’ is also part of the 
soundtrack to ‘Socrates One Of Us’,&nbsp;directed by Mimmo Calopresti, 
and Nico’s Von Archive co-curator, Spanish film&nbsp;director Carlos 
Casas is producing an individual video for each track.</p><p>On January 
2015, Ninos Du Brasil step up to DFA with a pair of virile, 
snaking&nbsp;batacuda techno riddims following on from their brilliant 
‘Novos Mistérios’ LP for&nbsp;Hospital Productions. The duo have at once
 refined, loosened and expanded their&nbsp;sound here, tilting technoid 
pulses thru mazy time signatures to resemble the&nbsp;soundtrack for a 
Sepultura after-party set in “the bushes of Queimada Grande&nbsp;(Snake 
Island, Brazil.)” Named after a genus of stinky frog found in the 
Amazon,&nbsp;‘Aromobates NDB’ is a viscous reduction of triplet-driven 
techno and phantasmic&nbsp;forest voices pent with a sweaty, febrile 
agenda and swarming electronics. ‘Clelia&nbsp;Clelia’ is the antidote to
 that sensual tension, firing flurries of tribalist 
percussion&nbsp;around booming kicks and skating electronics reminding 
us of early Warp sounds.</p><p>On January 2016 Ninos Du Brasil return on
 Hospital Productions with two new&nbsp;extended productions captured in
 a 12″ called “Para Araras”.&nbsp;This 12″ finds them upping their 
production levels to deliver an oddly compelling&nbsp;blend of joyous 
adventure theme-park music crossed with the chaos and 
explosive&nbsp;tension of mass street protests.</p><p>In the most honest
 sense, both sides live up to the thrill of their ecstatic, 
confettistrewn&nbsp;live shows, while proving effectively deadly as DJ

<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                More personal than all his 
albums to date, with his second studio effort – Bahdeni Nami – Omar 
Souleyman returns to a collaboration with his favourite but not only 
poet, Ahmad Alsamer, who penned his pre-west hits Kaset Hanzel, 
Khattaba, and Shift –al Mani.Recorded closer to home, in Istanbul, with 
poet in residence and heard throughout with claps and wails of 
encouragement, it features saz fireworks and support from Khaled 
Youssef. Keyboards by Rizan Said improvise devotedly and with skill to 
every tune and turn of Omar Souleyman’s choice. His lyrics declare 
eternal love, console one’s aching heart, decide to let her go, and ask 
her to sleep in his arms forever – in 4 fast dance numbers, an 
introduction mawal and an elaborate araby style ballad.</p><p>After his 
first studio album – Wenu Wenu – produced by FourTet, Omar Souleyman 
opens it up here to a number of hard-core musician fans, offering their 
own takes on Omar’s optimal sound. He is humbled and finds himself 
fortunate that all of them are inspired by his music and want to be 
close to it.</p><p>Kieran Hebden returns to produce&nbsp; – Bahdeni 
Nami, Modeselktor appropriately luck out with 2 fastest dance numbers, 
Legowelt offers a remix for the title track and Cole Alexander of the 
Black Lips treats one of the heart wounding ballads.</p><p>Omar 
Souleyman continues tirelessly to bring his wild dance party to all 
corners of the world and prides himself very much on having sung at the 
Nobel Peace Prize Concert recently. From Syria in the Hasake region, 
Omar earned his reputation singing and leading years of weddings, 
birthdays, Christenings, corporate parties and the like, answering to 
invites from all peoples living in the region – be it Muslims, 
Christians, Kurds, Iraqis, Syriacs, Assyrians. His voice and style stood
 out as he adopted his songs and lyrics to make everyone equally happy. 
Those parties yielded hundreds of cassette tapes at first offered as 
gifts and later distributed throughout the region and other Arab 
countries. Despite world’s insistence to associate him with his home 
country’s unending war, Omar gives back nothing but Love.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Curated in collaboration with Nuits Sonores.</p><p></p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Pablo Garcia</h1>

 exhibited&nbsp;artworks, provocations and research studies. Born in 
1975, Garcia was in college when the first internet 
browser&nbsp;launched. Composite training in traditional analog and 
then-nascent digital technologies inspired a research practice&nbsp;into
 the intersection and overlap of art and technology, obsolescence and 
the cutting edge, the real and the virtual.&nbsp;Garcia’s work ranges 
from scholarly contributions to art historical studies to contemporary 
artworks examining&nbsp;digital culture.</p><p>His expertise in the 
history and technique of drawing technologies has contributed to 
research for institutions such&nbsp;as The Art Institute of Chicago, The
 American Philosophical Society, The Polytechnic Museum (Moscow), and 
The&nbsp;Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (London). Garcia’s work has been 
exhibited in galleries and festivals across North America,&nbsp;South 
America, and Europe. His work has also been featured in the most 
widely-read journals in the world, including&nbsp;Art in America, WIRED,

artist and engineer who uses code and light to turn data into stunning 
landscapes. His landscapes address the problem of scale and the 
development of technology to perceive beyond the world in front of us. 
This technology helps us to see where our eyes are otherwise blind, 
pushing our cognitive limits. Patricio’s landscapes are not just 
representations of space but compositions of time and perception. 
Although his work is technically sophisticated his process is driven by 
curiosity and playful tinkering. Binoculars, telescopes, astrolabes, 
compasses, grids, maps, and photographs are some of the apparatus that 
trigger his imagination.</p><p>Patricio’s work has been shown at FILE 
Festival (2012, 2013), Espacio Fundación Telefónica, and FASE. He was a 
MediaLab resident at Centro Cultural Español. Patricio currently makes 
open source mapping tools at Mapzen. His work has been featured in

by electronic since I’m teenager. At that time, I used to opened, 
repaired and hacked every electronic stuff fallen in my hand (and from 
time to time destroyed too). I was particularly enthusiasting about Diy 
kits from 80’s.</p><p>I’ve re-discovered my firsts enthusiasms in 2009 
when I’ve start to build some guitar effects and amps for myself, shared
 with the Diy community and for few&nbsp; musicians around my city. I 
found many joy to do audio research for myself and share my work on the 
net.</p><p>In 2010, at the request of a musician friend, I made an 
analog ribbon controlled synth based on my analog dephasing filter’s 
research and choose to released it as a kit for hobbyists. This is the 
starting point of Razmasynth. Few month later, a friend of mine started 
the modular synthesis and show me his eurorack modular rack: That was a 
shock! I’ve immediately understood the advantage of this kind of support
 for a developer. The first Razmasynth module was released, named 
“Cthulhu” and directly based on the “Razmasynth mini” synthetizer. After
 selling a small batch of full mounted units, I come back to my firsts

 modules will resounds with personality, won’t be a clone of existing 
stuff, will be ergonomic and have professional conception.</p><p>-The

 self appropriate the module they will build, and push to hack them.</p><p>-The schematics are public &amp; under creative commons licences.</p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Refik Anadol</h1>

 the ways in which the transformation of the subject of contemporary

perception of space. Anadol builds his works on the nomadic subject’s 
reaction to and interactions with unconventional spatial orientations. 
Embedding media arts into architecture, he questions the possibility of a
 post digital architectural future in which there are no more 
non-digital realities. He invites the viewers to visualize alternative 
realities by presenting them the possibility of re-defining the 
functionalities of both interior and exterior architectural formations.

<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Given the fact that he entered 
the world of the electronic rhythms at an early stage of his life, 
strongly influenced by the break culture, it was about a time that Milos
 Pavlovic aka Regen would start engaging the local scene and releasing 
music with at the first given opportunity.</p><p>At the age of seven, he
 started overcoming the fundamentals of music theory by attending an 
elementary music school in Belgrade, which proved to be an important 
step for his later full dedication to the sound.</p><p>During the ‘90s 
era, as there were no local record shops in Belgrade, being one of the 
few lucky young people at that time in Serbia, studying English courses 
in England and abroad, he started following his real obsession, 
collecting and buying vinyl.</p><p>His passion for the electronic music 
gained its’ concrete form in 1997. when he just turned eighteen and 
finally began playing in Belgrade’s underground clubs. At first came the
 residency of a famous Belgrade underground club Omen, where he played 
Thursdays. Soon after his first appearance in a local cult techno club 
Industria, at the start of the season 1998, he gained a weekly 
residency.</p><p>After years, naturally his love and dedication to music
 led him to start writing and producing his own music, so it was just a 
matter of time when his debit work came out in 2006. for the local 
compilation “Belgrade Coffee Shop – Area 6′′. Soon after, his diverse 
work injected some serious techno EP’s on labels such as Ilian Tape, 
Harry Klein Records, Traut Muzik, Deep Labs, Argumento.</p><p>Nowadays, 
Milos has a strong connection with his mother label Ilian Tape from 
Munich. He has been in touch with the label and infatuated with the 
philosophy behind it since the beginning and released most of his works 
on it under his moniker Regen. In his productions, Milos tends to 
strongly nurture traditional techno values from the 90’s, by always 
having in mind the past, the now and the future, so to say. In a Dj 
role, his sets are as sharp as his experience, tending to hold the 
audience attention to the highest peek of their imagination and giving 
them what they need, simply spellbinding.</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/Regenenhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/regen! http://www.discogs.com/artist/1298434-Regen-2</p><p></p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Ricardo Cabello</h1>

 on September 23, 1984, in Paris, he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts
 before working for various animation and post-production studios in 
Paris. He also worked as a VJ at numerous events in France and across 
Europe, which led him to further examine the complex connections between
 sound and image. With this experience,Tardy, along with three other 
artists, created the European visual label Antivj in 2008, which formed 
the base of his research and work on projected light and its in uence on
 perception. He remained one of the label’s main artists until late 
2013.</p><p>His installations, which often use the technique of 
videomapping, are conceived as tangible experiences in situ and use 
light as a way to enhance existing architecture or original structures. 
By examining our relationship to reality as we are confronted by 
computer imagery and the social changes that it triggers, as well as the
 way that digital technology is situated in public space,Tardy’s

<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                The Italian artist Rudi Punzo 
has always been entranced with the idea of metamorphosis and its 
relationship to the artist’s creative process – the transformation of 
one material into another. He combines this interest into musical 
kinetic works, resulting in a mesmerizing alchemy of wondrous sculptural
 and aural hybrids and the creation of artworks that combine sculpture, 
sound, video projections and performance into multi-sensory experiences.
 Animating recycled and discarded materials with renewable energy 
sources – most notably, solar energy – the sculptural elements in his 
works are transformed through his interactions with them, their own 
kinetic movements and the amplification and sampling of the sounds these
 elements create. He has exhibited his works in numerous galleries and 
museums, including the Haslla Museum in South Korea and the Kuandu 
Museum in Taiwan; and he has performed his works at such venues as 
Electro-Mechanica in Russia and FAD in Brazil. He also has presented his

<!--    --><!--<!--        <img src="--><!--<!--">-->
<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Born in Poughkeepsie, NY, Sophi
 Kravitz is an American artist. Early in her career she studied 
sculpture and bronze casting while building props and FX for movies (if 
it was a bleeding body part on TV in the 90s, she may have made it). 
Kravitz was a studio assistant to Jeff Koons, who she highly admires and
 considers a huge influence on her work.</p><p>Later, needing to make a 
living, she called on her science side and pursued an education, and 
then a career in engineering. She worked on room-sized process equipment
 and robotics large and small.</p><p>Kravitz’s works can be found 
primarily as temporary public interactive art. She currently lives and 
works near New York City, in the Hudson Valley.</p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Squarepusher</h1>
<!--    --><!--<!--        <img src="--><!--<!--">-->
<!--    -->    <p></p><p>                Tom “Squarepusher” Jenkinson 
makes manic, schizoid, experimental drum’n’bass with a heavy progressive
 jazz influence and a lean toward pushing the clichés of the genre out 
the proverbial window. Rising from near-total obscurity to drum’n’bass 
cause célèbre in the space of a couple of months, Jenkinson released 
only a pair of EPs and a DJ Food remix for the latter’s Refried Food 
series before securing EP and LP release plans with three different 
labels. His first full-length work, Feed Me Weird Things (on Richard 
“Aphex Twin” James’ Rephlex label), was a dizzying, quixotic blend of 
super-fast jungle breaks with Aphex-style synth textures, goofy, offbeat
 melodies, and instrumental arrangements (he samples his own playing for
 his tracks) that vaguely recall jazz fusion pioneers such as Mahavishnu
 Orchestra and Weather Report. A skilled bassist and 
multi-instrumentalist, Jenkinson’s fretless accompaniment is a staple of
 his music and one of the more obvious affiliations with jazz (although 
his formal arrangements are often as jazz-derived as his playing).</p><p>Jenkinson
 grew up listening to jazz and dub greats like Miles Davis, Augustus 
Pablo, Charlie Parker, and Art Blakey. The son of a jazz drummer, 
Jenkinson followed in his father’s footsteps, playing bass and drums in 
high school. Introduced to electronic music through experimental 
electro-techno artists such as LFO and Carl Craig, Jenkinson soon began 
assembling his disparate influences into amalgams of breakbeat techno 
and post-bop avant-garde and progressive jazz. Claiming a closer 
affinity with jazz than jungle (although he draws from both equally in 
his music), Jenkinson’s EPs as Squarepusher and the Duke of Harringay 
(Jenkinson moved to Harringay from his Chelmsford birthplace) were 
initially disregarded as misplaced perversions of jungle’s more obvious 
compositional principles, but found ready audiences in fans of post-acid
 house experimental listening music. He inked a deal with Warp in 1995, 
releasing the Port Rhombus EP and three others through a variety of 
different labels. The aforementioned full-length Feed Me Weird Things 
appeared in 1996, followed a year later by Hard Normal Daddy.</p><p>Critical
 acclaim for Jenkinson’s work peaked with 1998’s Music Is Rotted One 
Note, for which he became a one-man fusion group — multi-tracking 
himself playing drums, bass, and keyboards. The following year, he 
released two EPs (Budakhan Mindphone, Maximum Priest) and another full 
LP, Selection Sixteen. Go Plastic appeared in summer 2001, featuring the
 closest thing to a hit Squarepusher had ever seen with the single “My 
Red Hot Car.” Subsequent releases such as 2003’s Do You Know 
Squarepusher and 2004’s Ultravisitor found him refining his fusion of 
composition, programming, and musicianship, characteristics that were 
also heard on 2006’s Hello Everything and 2008’s Just a Souvenir. After a
 record of solo bass (titled Solo Electric Bass, Vol. 1), he unveiled 
his next project, a masked foursome named Shobaleader One that released a
 2010 collaboration album (Shobaleader One: D’demonstrator) consisting 
of throwback electronic pop with an R&amp;B edge and synthesized vocals,
 not unlike Daft Punk. In 2012, Jenkinson returned with the coldly 
symphonic Ufabulum, adding an apocalyptic soundtrack feel to his already
 dense programming. In 2013, he worked with a team of Japanese 
roboticists on an ambitious project called Z-Machines, the creation of 
robots that could play music far beyond the capabilities of even the 
most skilled human instrumentalists. Jenkinson aided the robotics team 
in the composition of music for these robots to play, set to life by a 
22-armed drumming robot and a guitar-playing robot with the equivalent 
of 78 fingers. The next year, Warp Records released the Music for Robots
 EP, a five-song recording of the results of the experiment. 2015 saw 
the release of Damogen Furies, a full-length that found Jenkinson 
pushing the limits of even his own unbridled hysteria, employing 
punishing overdriven tones on almost every beat, synth, and bassline on 
the album.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Curated in collaboration with TodaysArt.</p><p></p><p>                </p><p>            </p>    <h1>Supporting AV creators today</h1>
